```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Saying hello to the world

One of the most widely known functions: hello(). This functions has no arguments. It's use is self-explanatory, see below.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(testpckg1337)
hello()
```

## Saying hello to anybody you want

Now the above funtion is great, but a little variety will certainly not hurt. The hello.name() function takes one argument *name* (character) and returns a string which may be used to greet anybody.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hello.name("Ann")
x <- hello.name("Christian")
x
```

If the argument *name* is not a string, an error is thrown, see below.

```{r, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE}
hello.name(1337)
```
